Second Report for a Student Chosen Project

Do the following:

1. In the table below, list the dates, amount of time spent, and
description of the work that you did on your project. Follow the example
that is in the first row of the table below. Include the time you spent
doing any of the following:
    a. discussing your project with your teacher, tutor, or fellow students
    2024-04-03  2.0     I had a conversation with my classmate about my project. The talking with my classmate really helped me out to
    organize my ideas and put them into coding. At that time, I have written some example code but it was not complete at all.

    b. researching by reading articles and watching applicable videos
    2024-03-25  5.0      I started thinking how to do it my project because I had an idea of what to do. I was looking into the Ministry
    of Transportation website to get the data. I realized that the data was only in PDF format and I was hoping to at least get the
    data in CSV or JSON format, so I spent some hours looking through it. I also spent quite a lot of time because I did not want to use
    the PDF format without making sure that there was no other better file to extract the data from. 

    c. designing your project by drawing diagrams and other applicable documents
    2024-03-26  1.0     Before starting to write any code, I drew in a writing tablet what where my ideas to start to write code. How
    I was going to write it and I drew a small plan. Unfortunately, my writing tablet cannot be saved and with a button all is deleted.
    More than a writing tablet, it is a writing tablet for kids.

    d. writing experimental code
    2024-03-31  2.0     When I knew that there was no CSV file and only a PDF file of the data that I wanted, I first used a library called
    PyPDF. I tried to extract the data from my PDF into a dictionary with it but it did not work because it was extracting more information
    that I needed. I saw that the PDF was in tabular data, and I found another library called Tabula. Tabula worked much better.

    d. writing code for your project
    2024-04-06 2.0      I had more progress with my code. I tried to make sure that I fulfill the project requirements.
    I wrote 4 functions. 
    e. writing test functions
    2024-04-06 2.0      This was the hardest part for me. Hopefully, I am testing my program correctly.
    Because my program asks an input from the user. It was harder to test it. I wrote some comments on my program
    explaining it.
    f. debugging your code
    2024-04-07 1.0      I probably spent more than one hour, I read the docs, read some StackOverflow answers, and watch some YouTube videos.
