445,X,

"",,Drivers making a left turn at an intersection should indicate their intention to turn
446,X,using their left turn signal or an arm signal just as they are about to make their

449,X,last minute and decide they don't want to turn.
"",,"To avoid accidents, vehicle drivers should watch out for motorcycles that"
450,O,suddenly turn left in front of them with no warning.

452,X,"parking space, but they do not have to signal their turn signal light."

453,X,vehicle in front of them.
"",,When passing other vehicles on a two-way road with a broken yellow line
454,O,"separating oncoming traffic, drivers should spend the least amount of time"

455,O,another vehicle.
"",,"Before attempting to pass another vehicle, the driver should shift into a higher"
456,X,gear in order to improve their ability to accelerate quickly while passing.
"",,Drivers should slow down before beginning a turn. If a driver has to brake during
457,O,"the turn itself, it means they didn't slow down enough before beginning their"
"",,turn.
"",,Drivers may go ahead and change lanes or make a turn without using their turn
458,X,signal light if they are in a hurry.

459,O,speed even when changing lanes.
"",,"If there is a solid white double line separating the lanes, drivers may change"
460,X,lanes so they can make a left or right turn at their convenience.
